## Komodo Token Explorer rewrite in NextJS

Previous version of the explorer was implemented based on KMD version of Insight Explorer. While previous version had quite wide range of various features like standard blocks/transactions lookup it's code is dated and written in ES5 w/o any support for bundlers or code checkers.

Current version is a boiled down version of Insight Explorer with tokens support only, no extra features and is written using modern NextJS framework.
